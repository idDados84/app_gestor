  # Fix RLS policies for contas_receber table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policy that prevents INSERT operations
    - Create comprehensive policies for all CRUD operations
    - Allow both authenticated and public access for development
    - Maintain RLS enabled for security

  This resolves the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
  and allows proper CRUD operations on contas_receber.

-- Drop existing restrictive policy

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on contas_receber for public users"
